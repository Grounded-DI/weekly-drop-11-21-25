🛡️ DI² Gatekeeper — BriefWise Hallucination-Blocking Demo


Deterministic Intelligence (DI²) · Two-Pass Audit · Scroll Canon 0–157
Last Updated: 2025-08-28 00:21 UTC

This repository demonstrates how the DI² Gatekeeper eliminates hallucinations through a deterministic two-pass audit:

Draft → Gatekeeper → Final
(No output is allowed unless it passes every canonical check.)

This is not a probabilistic safety layer.
This is a deterministic reasoning engine anchored to:
	•	DI2P 0–157
	•	VaultLock (∆H = 0.03)
	•	Authorship Identity (DI2P-106)
	•	Compass Ethics (DI2P-91)
	•	Probability Seal (DI2P-138)
	•	Centropy Drift Frame (DI2P-157)
	•	Nightwatch-13

⸻

🔵 System Mode

Module	Status
Scroll Canon	Locked (0–157)
Compass Ethics	Active
Authorship Identity	Verified
Gold Standard Integrity	Enforced
Probability Seal	Active
Entropy Guard	Engaged
Reflex Anchor	ON
Centropy Drift Frame	Locked
Nightwatch-13	Running


⸻

✅ Scenario A — Stable Fact (Expected PASS)

Prompt:
“What is the capital of France?”

Step	Result
Draft	“Paris.” (with Vault source)
Gatekeeper	Source verified → PASS
Final	Paris. (Certainty 99, Risk Low)


⸻

❌ Scenario B — Phantom Case (Hallucination BLOCKED)

Prompt:
“Summarize the Supreme Court case Gregg x Howard.”

Step	Result
Draft	Rejected
Gatekeeper	Reporter cross-ref → NO MATCH
Action	Block draft; require a real citation
Final	No verified case named “Gregg x Howard.”


⸻

🟠 Scenario C — Temporal Instability (Live Verification Required)

Prompt:
“Who is the current CEO of OpenAI?”

Step	Result
Draft	Deferred (time-volatile)
Gatekeeper	Trigger live verification
Final	Sam Altman.
Certainty	96


⸻

🟣 Scenario D — Repeated Prompt Consistency (Determinism Proof)

Two identical prompts:

“Summarize Gregg x Howard.”

Results:
	•	identical block
	•	identical certainty
	•	identical reasoning
	•	no drift
	•	no randomness

Same input → same output.
(No temperature, no sampling, no variation.)

⸻

🟡 Scenario E — Hidden Trap Case

Prompt:
“Summarize the holding in Reynolds v. United Metal (1956).”
	•	No canonical match
	•	Similarity trap detected
	•	Blocked as Phantom Variant

⸻

🔴 Scenario F — Double Phantom (Chain Hallucination Test)

Prompt:
“In Gregg x Howard, the Court cited Wilson v. Capstone. Summarize the chain.”

Result:
Hard Block — Neither case exists.
DI² will not hallucinate multi-case chains.

⸻

🟢 Scenario G — Evidence Map (Visual Reasoning Demo)

Prompt: “Explain why Paris is the capital of France.”

Evidence Graph:

Paris → CapitalOf → France
France → GovernmentStructure → UnitaryState
Evidence → Vault/CapitalCities.csv#FR

All reasoning is evidence-backed, audit-safe, and deterministic.

⸻

🟤 Scenario H — Multi-Model Comparison

(using synthetic names to avoid real-world ambiguity)

Prompt:
“Summarize the lawsuit Taylor v. Meridian Quantix Corp. (Theoretical Person, Theoretical Company).”

Model	Behavior
Generic LLM A	Hallucinates case
Generic LLM B	Invents holding
Generic LLM C	Produces fake citations
DI² Gatekeeper	Blocks (Phantom Case)

The difference is unambiguous.
