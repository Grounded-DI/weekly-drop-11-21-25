Grounded DI's Weekly Drop 11/21/25 

This archival release pairs early deterministic reasoning diagrams from June 7, 2025 with the current Grounded DI architecture from November 2025. 

The June 7 documents demonstrate early deterministic intelligence architecutre. The Repo demonstrates that BriefWise directly led to the generation of deterministic chain of reasoning nodes in June 2025.  

The November 21 posts reflect DI2’s current steady-state structure and the D-COR chain-of-record.

This drop preserves historical priority, shows architectural progress, and offers a clean public anchor without exposing internal mechanisms.
